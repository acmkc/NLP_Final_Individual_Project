# NLP Final-Individual-Project-Group4

## Introduction
As a business person with a marketing background, I would like to explore the usage of NLP
techniques to address common marketing problems – the customer service team spending too much
time on reading each product's review might delay the messages that could be more urgent,
leading to more complaints. Therefore, to mitigate this problem, I built a sentiment classifier to help
the customer service team prioritize their tasks by categorizing the sentiment of the incoming product
reviews. This sentiment classifier can detect whether the reviews are positive or negative. I used a
pre-trained model to fine-tune the Amazon pets' product reviews dataset. Therefore, this model
might be ideal for retailers in the pet supplies industry.

This project encompasses two parts – Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis, which helps us know more
about this dataset and gain insights about what customers talk about in their reviews; Part 2.
Sentiment Analysis using a baseline model and a fine-tuned pre-trained model.


## To train the model
